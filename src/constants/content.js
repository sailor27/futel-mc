  Retrofitting the format popular on Craigslist for a public telephone,
  Futel Missed Connections will invite passersby to record short,
  anonymous audio messages and listen and reply to messages recorded on
  the NE MLK Futel phone. Missed connections are a way to archive the way
  we encounter each other in public space, and to explore unfulfilled
  potentials. In gathering recordings of what could-have-been, Futel
  Missed Connections will superimpose a collective re-imagination onto the
  neighborhood, revealing the dreams and observations of those who
  co-occupy the space, and creating an opportunity to connect.
