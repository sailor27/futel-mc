  Retrofitting the format popular on Craigslist for a public telephone,
  Futel Missed Connections will invite passersby to record short,
  anonymous audio messages and listen and reply to messages recorded on
  the NE MLK Futel phone. Missed connections are a way to archive the way
  we encounter each other in public space, and to explore unfulfilled
  potentials. In gathering recordings of what could-have-been, Futel
  Missed Connections will superimpose a collective re-imagination onto the
  neighborhood, revealing the dreams and observations of those who
  co-occupy the space, and creating an opportunity to connect.

export const WHY_MC = `I'm interested in the way the Missed Connections format draws out desires, dreams, and imagined potentials from passerbys in the public space. Often centered in urban areas and around transit, Missed Connections expose the lack of connection felt by "strangers" in the public space and the reality that while we exist with others in space, for good reasons it is not always safe, practical, or possible to connect. 

I see sites of recorded Missed Connections as a time and space superimposed on the city, which reveals fleeting senses of what could have been. In gathering these impressions of what-could-have been together, we can see a glimpse of a collective re-imagining of our local world.`;
